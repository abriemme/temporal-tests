"""Temporal worker using Worker Deployment Versioning.

The ``build_id`` comes from the git SHA (see ``app.config.get_build_id``). Each
build/deployment therefore exposes a new worker *version* under the same
``deployment_name``, which enables controlled rolling deployments on the server
side (traffic ramp, rollback, etc.).
